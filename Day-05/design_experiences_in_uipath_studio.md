### Design Experiences and installing the UiPath extensions

There are two design experiences available at UiPath Studio: Modern and Classic. The Modern experience features a user-friendly interface with new features, while the Classic experience has a traditional interface.
In UiPath Studio, the **Modern experience is used by default**, but users can switch to the Classic experience depending on their needs.

#### Is it possible to change the user experience in UiPath Studio? 

Yes, It's possible with UiPath Studio to change the design experience based on our requirements in two ways:

- Change the default design experience at the Studio level.

  For all new projects, we can set this from  Backstage View > Settings > Design.

- Change the design experience at the project level.

  The default design experience is set at project level from Project Settings or for all new projects from the Project tab > Project Settings > General.

### What are browser extensions? 

Browser extensions enable automation tools to interact with the user interface of web applications in UI automation projects. Each browser has different extensions that interact with the application differently, like different sets of keys for different doors.
For instance, Microsoft Edge extensions use the **manifest.json** file to define their structure and functionality. Chrome extension **UiPath Web Automation**.

### How to install and enable UiPath Extensions: 

- Open UiPath Studio and click the "Tools" tab.

- Navigate to the "Uipath Extensions" tab.

- Choose the extension you want to automate from the list
  of available extensions.

- Click on the "Install" button.

- Wait for the extension to be installed. Once it's done,
  the status of the extension will change to "Installed".

- Restart UiPath Studio for the changes to take effect.

- After completing these steps, the extension will be
  installed and you'll be able to automate web applications in the selected browser.

### Summary

The Modern design is the default design experience in UiPath Studio and users can change the design experience in two ways: Studio level and Project-level.

The Studio level change applies the new experience to all the projects created in UiPath Studio. This means that if you change the design experience at the Studio level, it'll apply to all the projects you create or open in UiPath Studio.

The project level change applies to the design experience only to individual projects. This means that if you change the design experience at the project level, it'll only apply to the specific project you are working on, and other projects won't be affected.
