### Core RPA Components

**Studio, Orchestrator** and **Robots** are the core RPA components of the UiPath Platform.

We call them the core components because RPA can't work without developing automations, running them, and managing the entire ecosystem.

- **UiPath Studio** is a tool for building automation processes.
- **UiPath Robot** executes the processes built in Studio published to Orchestrator or locally.
- **UiPath Orchestrator** is a web application that acts as the interface between Studio and Robot and manages, controls, and monitors automation tasks.
- Human users can trigger robots, through the UiPath Assistant tool to execute processes on their machines. We call these robots **attended robots**.
- The robots deployed on separate machines, working without direct human intervention, are called **Unattended Robots**. Process execution for this type of robots is initiated and managed from Orchestrator.
