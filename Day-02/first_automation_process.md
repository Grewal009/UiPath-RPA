### Business scenario:

Each day, ACME's Sales department receives reports from coffee shops in Excel format.

A dedicated member of the team extracts the data from each report, merges it into an Excel spreadsheet, and then creates a pivot table and a chart based on the merged data.

### Q1. What are some automation best practices to consider when automating a project?

- Workflow files, activities, arguments, and variables should have meaningful names, to accurately describe their usage throughout the project.
- Choosing the appropriate layout type for the process we are building (sequences, flowcharts, state machines).
- Using a Version Control System to easily manage project versioning and sharing the work of more developers.
- Using Upper Camel Case naming convention for workflows.
- Making sure that output files are deleted at the beginning of processes before running. (except this all are correct)

### Q2. How can we purposely pause the debugging process on an activity which may trigger execution issues?

- By using the Step Into button from the Debug tab while debugging.
- By enabling the Highlight Elements function from the Debug tab before debugging.
- By using the Step Out button from the Debug tab while debugging.
- By right-clicking the activity, and selecting Toggle Breakpoint to add and enable the breakpoint. (correct)
