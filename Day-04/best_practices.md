### Best practicesÂ 

- Sequences have a simple linear representation that flows from top to bottom. They are best suited for simple scenarios when activities follow each other and there are very few or no decisions.

- Flowcharts offer more flexibility for connecting activities and tend to lay out a workflow in a plane two-dimensional manner. Because of its free form and visual appeal, flowcharts are best suited when multiple decisions are required in a process.

- The IF activity splits a sequence vertically and is perfect for short balanced linear branches. Nested If statements should be avoided to keep the workflow simple/linear.

- When using Flow Decision activities, make sure that the conditions are clear and concise. The same applies for Flow Switch.

- The VB If operator is very useful for minor local conditions or data computing, and it can sometimes reduce a whole block to a single activity.

- When using Switch activities, always include a default case to handle unexpected cases that may occur.

- Overall, decisions need to be implemented in a workflow to enable the Robot to react differently in various conditions in data processing and application interaction. Choosing the right representation for a condition and its branches has a significant impact on the workflow's visual structure and readability.

Layouts refer to the visual organization of your activities within a workflow.

Conditional statements, on the other hand, are programming constructs that allow you to control the flow of your automation based on certain conditions or criteria.

By using layouts and conditional statements together, you can create complex automation workflows that are both easy to understand and highly functional.
