### If statement

In UiPath Studio the If statement, or activity, consists of the following elements:

- **Condition** that's verified with two potential outcomes: true or false. This field only accepts Boolean expressions.
- **Then branch** the set of actions executed when the condition is true.
- Optional **Else branch** the set of actions executed when the condition is false.

### What are loops?

Loops are an essential part of automation workflows, as they allow for repeating a set of operations based on a given condition. This can be useful for iterating through large sets of data, processing information, or executing certain tasks until a specific condition is met.

In UiPath Studio, the most important loops are: Do While, While and For Each.

### Switch

Switch is a type of control flow activity that enables you to select one choice out of multiple, based on the value of a specified expression.

The Switch activity can be useful to categorize data according to a custom number of cases. Depending on the case, you can have a set of activities that differ for each case. You can also set actions to take if the condition isn't matched with any defined case.
